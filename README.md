## 🚀 Setup & Deploy

This site is designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Repository Setup**: Create a public GitHub repository named `your-username.github.io`.
2.  **Upload Files**: Upload the `index.html`, `README.md`, and the `assets` folder to the root of this repository.
3.  **Go Live**: The site will be automatically deployed and available at `https://your-username.github.io`.

> **Note**: If you use a different repository name (e.g., `my-gallery`), the site will be at `https://your-username.github.io/my-gallery/`. In this case, you must ensure all asset paths in `index.html` start with `./` (e.g., `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">`) to work correctly.

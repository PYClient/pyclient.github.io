## ✨ Key Features

This project was built from the ground up to include a variety of modern web features:

*   **Tabbed Interface**: Content is organized into clean, switchable tabs for a seamless user experience.
*   **Dynamic Video Gallery**: The gallery is populated entirely on the client-side, making the content easily manageable within the code.
*   **Live Search**: An instant search bar allows users to filter the extensive video collection by title in real-time.
*   **Multiple View Modes**: Users can instantly switch the gallery layout between **compact**, **normal**, and **large** views using a minimal toggle control.
*   **Persistent Dark/Light Theme**: A theme toggle allows users to switch between dark and light modes, with their preference saved in `localStorage` for future visits.
*   **Performance Optimized**: Utilizes the `IntersectionObserver` API to lazy-load video iframes, ensuring a fast initial page load and saving bandwidth.
*   **Back-to-Top Button**: A convenient arrow appears on scroll, allowing users to return to the top of the page with a single click.
*   **Fully Responsive Design**: The layout fluidly adapts to all screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## 💻 Technology Stack

This project intentionally avoids heavy dependencies to showcase proficiency with core web technologies.

*   **HTML5**: Semantic markup for a well-structured and accessible site.
*   **CSS3**: Modern styling techniques, including CSS Variables for easy theming, Flexbox, and Grid for layout.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: All dynamic functionality—including tab switching, search filtering, lazy-loading, and DOM manipulation—is handled with pure JavaScript.

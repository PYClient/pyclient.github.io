# Streamable Video Gallery Showcase

Welcome to my official GitHub website. Currently, it is the home of my Streamable Video Gallery Showcase, a modern, feature-rich static website designed to demonstrate key front-end development techniques using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a practical example of building a responsive, high-performance, and user-friendly web application that relies on no external frameworks.

## ✨ Key Features

This project was built from the ground up to include a variety of modern web features:

*   **Tabbed Interface**: Content is organized into clean, switchable tabs for a seamless user experience.
*   **Dynamic Video Gallery**: The gallery is populated entirely on the client-side, making the content easily manageable within the code.
*   **Live Search**: An instant search bar allows users to filter the extensive video collection by title in real-time.
*   **Multiple View Modes**: Users can instantly switch the gallery layout between **compact**, **normal**, and **large** views using a minimal toggle control.
*   **Back-to-Top Button**: A convenient arrow appears on scroll, allowing users to return to the top of the page with a single click.
*   **Fully Responsive Design**: The layout fluidly adapts to all screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
